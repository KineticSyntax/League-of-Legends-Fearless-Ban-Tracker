## About

This project is a tracker designed to help manage **Fearless Bans** in League of Legends custom games.

The goal is to simplify tracking which champions are no longer available.

---

## Game Modes

There will be two selectable modes:

### ➤ Normal Mode
When a champion is **played**, that champion can no longer be played again.

### ➤ Double Mode
When a champion is **played OR banned**, that champion can no longer be played again.

---

## Lobby System (Planned)

You will be able to:

- Create a lobby
- Receive a unique invite code
- Share the code with other players
- Allow others to view:
  - Banned champions
  - Available champions

Only the lobby creator will be able to:
- Add banned/played champions
- Control the session

---

## Champion Filtering (Planned)

You will be able to:

- List champions by:
  - Role
  - Class 
  - Type
  - Name
- Search and filter champions

---

## Hosting

There **may** eventually be a public website where you can access the tracker.

However, you will always be able to:

- Run it locally
- Host it yourself
